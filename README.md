# GuessingGameWeb

I built this guessing game as a way to solidify the knowledge I gained while teaching myself how to code websites.

I learnt how to build a page and style it using html and css. I then learnt how I can work with javascript and 
jquery to modify the behaviour of the page.

This little game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The user then guesses what it might be by typing a number
in the box and then pressing the 'Guess' button. The game responds by specifying weather the guess was too high, too
low or correct. At any time the user can press the 'Restart' button which will clear the input and select a new random
number. The script ensures that the guess is valid.

Using javascript I created my own color animation for the buttons. If a guess is correct the 'Guess' button flashes
green when pressed otherwise it flashes red. the restart button flashes green when clicked if the game has been won
otherwise it flashes red.

It is a relatively simple game but if I were to build upon this game I could allow the user to select the range
of the random number. I could also count the number of guesses it took fo them to guess the number. Instead I am 
starting on a new website that will have a retro arcade style game.
